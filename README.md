# Type Setting and Responsive Basic

-- Made from Bare Bones Boiler Plate 

## HTML
### Elements Included
1. I have included a header and a main element. 
2. The main element has 2 elements; an article and aside. 

**Main**

The main element has `display: flex;` set on it and the flex items as centred with `justify-content: center;` and 
`align-items: center;`.
That is all that is included since the main purpose of this boiler plate is CSS experimentation and drawing.

## CSS
### Reset CSS
I don't use a reset as such and prefer the idea of making base CSS style consistent. For that reason the boiler
plate uses normalize.css. It's included in the header and delivered via a CDN. If you prefer to download it, you can
visit https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css/

### Root and body color
I have added one custom property to override the body color this is for demonstration purposes and please change to 
a color. 

### Font 
There is no font set in the initial commit, so the font is default serif font.

### Box-sizing
We have set box-sizing to border-box using the most accept method that supports both content-box and padding-box
when needed.

## JavaScript
I have included a blank action.js file.
