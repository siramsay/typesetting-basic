    <h1>Bare Bones Boiler Plate</h1>
    <h2>HTML</h2>
    <h3>Elements Included</h3>

    <p>I have included a header and a main element.</p>
    <p>The main element has 2 elements; an article and aside.</p>

    <h4>Main</h4>

    <p>The main element has <code>display: flex;</code> set on it and the flex items as centred with
      <code>justify-content: center;</code>, <code>align-items: center;</code>. That is all that is included since the main purpose of
      this boiler plate is CSS experimentation and drawing.</p>

    <h2>CSS</h2>
    <h3>Reset CSS</h3>

    <p>I don't use a reset as such and prefer the idea of making base CSS style consistent. For that reason the boiler
    plate uses normalize.css. It's included in the header and delivered via a CDN. If you prefer to download it, you can visit https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css/ Root and body color</p>

    <p>I have added one custom property to override the body color this is for demonstration purposes and please change
      to a color.</p>

    <h3>Font</h3>

    <p>There is no font set in the initial commit, so the font is default serif font.</p>
    <h3>Box-sizing</h3>

    <p>We have set box-sizing to border-box using the most accept method that supports both content-box and padding-box
      when needed.</p>

    <h2>JavaScript</h2>

    <p>I have included a blank action.js file.</p>

  </article>
  <aside>
    <h2>Aside</h2>
    <p>Add stand alone content here. Thing such a list of related content, advertising, and polls.</p>
  </aside>

</main>

</body>
<script src="action.js"></script>
